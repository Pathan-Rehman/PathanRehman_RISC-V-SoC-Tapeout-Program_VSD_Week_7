# Week 7 Task – BabySoC Physical Design & Post-Route SPEF Generation

This document presents the complete physical design implementation of the BabySoC using OpenROAD, covering all stages from floorplanning to post-route parasitic extraction (SPEF generation). The objective of this task is to integrate the theoretical and practical aspects of digital design by executing a full RTL-to-GDSII flow on a real System-on-Chip (SoC).

Through this exercise, the BabySoC design undergoes floorplan definition, standard cell placement, routing, and parasitic extraction to reflect a realistic ASIC design process. Each stage is explored to understand how physical parameters—such as floorplan constraints, placement density, and routing topology—affect timing performance and design closure.

The outcome of this work is a fully placed and routed BabySoC layout, accompanied by a generated SPEF file that enables post-route Static Timing Analysis (STA). This provides insight into how parasitic effects influence signal delay and how accurate timing verification is performed in professional VLSI design environments.

Comprehensive screenshots, step-by-step procedures, and observations are documented to demonstrate the design flow, tools used, challenges encountered, and verification results.

### TLV to Verilog Conversion for RVMYTH

Initially, you will see only the `rvmyth.tlv` file inside `src/module/`, since the RVMYTH core is written in TL-Verilog.

To convert it into a `.v` file for simulation, follow the steps below:

<strong>🔧 TLV to Verilog Conversion Steps</strong>

```bash
# Step 1: Install python3-venv (if not already installed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip
```

<img width="1217" height="662" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a75955ab-5383-402f-b257-475adeaf671a" />

```
# Step 2: Create and activate a virtual environment
cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
python3 -m venv sp_env
source sp_env/bin/activate
```

<img width="1215" height="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc9e2d07-6968-4b5f-b6bf-e48b3a7a6365" />

```
# Step 3: Install SandPiper-SaaS inside the virtual environment
pip install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas
```

<img width="1212" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a223eeb-c06c-4f99-9059-e9dcf5ad1683" />

```
# Step 4: Convert rvmyth.tlv to Verilog
sandpiper-saas -i ./src/module/*.tlv -o rvmyth.v --bestsv --noline -p verilog --outdir ./src/module/
```

✅ After running the above command, rvmyth.v will be generated in the src/module/ directory.

You can confirm this by listing the files:

#### Note 
To use this environment in future sessions, always activate it first:
```bash
source sp_env/bin/activate
```
To exit:
```bash
deactivate
```
### Simulation Steps

#### <ins>Pre-Synthesis Simulation</ins>

Run the following command to perform a pre-synthesis simulation:

```bash
cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
mkdir -p output/pre_synth_sim
iverilog -o ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/testbench.v
```
<img width="1213" height="83" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab5e9f18-0fb7-4df9-86ca-066c14474a9a" />

Then run:
```bash
cd output/pre_synth_sim
./pre_synth_sim.out
```
<img width="894" height="44" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/506fb2e0-ab37-474d-a88a-68a75d6c3952" />

Explanation:

- DPRE_SYNTH_SIM: Defines the PRE_SYNTH_SIM macro for conditional compilation in the testbench.
- The resulting pre_synth_sim.vcd file can be viewed in GTKWave.

#### Viewing Waveform in GTKWave

After running the simulation, open the VCD file in GTKWave: 

```bash

cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
gtkwave output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.vcd

```
Drag and drop the CLK, reset, OUT (DAC), and RV TO DAC [9:0] signals to their respective locations in the simulation tool

<img width="1212" height="766" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c35f8dc-449a-417e-ad87-fba903b1f253" />

In this picture we can see the following signals:

**CLK**: This is the input CLK signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from the PLL, originally.

**reset**: This is the input reset signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from an external source, originally.

**OUT**: This is the output OUT signal of the VSDBabySoC module. This signal comes from the DAC (due to simulation restrictions it behaves like a digital signal which is incorrect), originally.

**RV_TO_DAC[9:0]**: This is the 10-bit output [9:0] OUT port of the RVMYTH core. This port comes from the RVMYTH register #17, originally.

**OUT**: This is a real datatype wire which can simulate analog values. It is the output wire real OUT signal of the DAC module. This signal comes from the DAC, originally. 

This can be viewed by changing the Data Format of the signal to Analog → Step

#### Viewing DAC output in analog mode

Drag and drop the CLK, reset, OUT (DAC) (as analog step), and RV TO DAC [9:0] signals to their respective locations in the simulation tool

### Trouble shooting tips

   - Module Redefinition: If you encounter redefinition errors, ensure modules are included only once, either in the testbench or in the command line.
   - Path Issues: Verify paths specified with -I are correct. Use full paths if relative paths cause errors.

## Why Pre-Synthesis and Post-Synthesis?

1. **Pre-Synthesis Simulation**: 
   - Focuses only on verifying functionality based on the RTL code.
   - Zero-delay environment, with events occurring on the active clock edge.

2. **Post-Synthesis Simulation (GLS)**:
   - Uses the synthesized netlist (gate-level) to simulate both functionality and timing.
   - Identifies timing violations and potential mismatches (e.g., unintended latches).
   - Helps verify dynamic circuit behavior that static methods may miss.
