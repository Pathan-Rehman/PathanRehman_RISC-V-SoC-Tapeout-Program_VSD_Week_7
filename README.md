# Week 7 Task – BabySoC Physical Design & Post-Route SPEF Generation

This document presents the complete physical design implementation of the BabySoC using OpenROAD, covering all stages from floorplanning to post-route parasitic extraction (SPEF generation). The objective of this task is to integrate the theoretical and practical aspects of digital design by executing a full RTL-to-GDSII flow on a real System-on-Chip (SoC).

Through this exercise, the BabySoC design undergoes floorplan definition, standard cell placement, routing, and parasitic extraction to reflect a realistic ASIC design process. Each stage is explored to understand how physical parameters—such as floorplan constraints, placement density, and routing topology—affect timing performance and design closure.

The outcome of this work is a fully placed and routed BabySoC layout, accompanied by a generated SPEF file that enables post-route Static Timing Analysis (STA). This provides insight into how parasitic effects influence signal delay and how accurate timing verification is performed in professional VLSI design environments.

Comprehensive screenshots, step-by-step procedures, and observations are documented to demonstrate the design flow, tools used, challenges encountered, and verification results.

### Simulation Steps

#### <ins>Pre-Synthesis Simulation</ins>

Run the following command to perform a pre-synthesis simulation:

```bash
cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
mkdir -p output/pre_synth_sim
iverilog -o ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/testbench.v
```
<img width="1213" height="83" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab5e9f18-0fb7-4df9-86ca-066c14474a9a" />

Then run:
```bash
cd output/pre_synth_sim
./pre_synth_sim.out
```
<img width="894" height="44" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/506fb2e0-ab37-474d-a88a-68a75d6c3952" />

Explanation:

- DPRE_SYNTH_SIM: Defines the PRE_SYNTH_SIM macro for conditional compilation in the testbench.
- The resulting pre_synth_sim.vcd file can be viewed in GTKWave.

#### Viewing Waveform in GTKWave

After running the simulation, open the VCD file in GTKWave: 

```bash

cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
gtkwave output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.vcd

```
Drag and drop the CLK, reset, OUT (DAC), and RV TO DAC [9:0] signals to their respective locations in the simulation tool

<img width="1212" height="766" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c35f8dc-449a-417e-ad87-fba903b1f253" />

In this picture we can see the following signals:

**CLK**: This is the input CLK signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from the PLL, originally.

**reset**: This is the input reset signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from an external source, originally.

**OUT**: This is the output OUT signal of the VSDBabySoC module. This signal comes from the DAC (due to simulation restrictions it behaves like a digital signal which is incorrect), originally.

**RV_TO_DAC[9:0]**: This is the 10-bit output [9:0] OUT port of the RVMYTH core. This port comes from the RVMYTH register #17, originally.

**OUT**: This is a real datatype wire which can simulate analog values. It is the output wire real OUT signal of the DAC module. This signal comes from the DAC, originally. 

This can be viewed by changing the Data Format of the signal to Analog → Step

#### Viewing DAC output in analog mode

Drag and drop the CLK, reset, OUT (DAC) (as analog step), and RV TO DAC [9:0] signals to their respective locations in the simulation tool

### Trouble shooting tips

   - Module Redefinition: If you encounter redefinition errors, ensure modules are included only once, either in the testbench or in the command line.
   - Path Issues: Verify paths specified with -I are correct. Use full paths if relative paths cause errors.

## Why Pre-Synthesis and Post-Synthesis?

1. **Pre-Synthesis Simulation**: 
   - Focuses only on verifying functionality based on the RTL code.
   - Zero-delay environment, with events occurring on the active clock edge.

2. **Post-Synthesis Simulation (GLS)**:
   - Uses the synthesized netlist (gate-level) to simulate both functionality and timing.
   - Identifies timing violations and potential mismatches (e.g., unintended latches).
   - Helps verify dynamic circuit behavior that static methods may miss.

## VSDBabySoC Post-Synthesis Simulation

Post-synthesis simulation is a critical step in the digital design flow, providing insights into both the functionality and timing of the synthesized design. 

Unlike pre-synthesis simulation, which focuses solely on verifying the functionality based on the RTL code, post-synthesis simulation uses the synthesized netlist to ensure that the design behaves correctly in terms of both logic and timing.

Key aspects of post-synthesis simulation include:

**Functionality and Timing Verification**: It checks the design's functionality and timing using the gate-level netlist, helping identify timing violations and potential mismatches such as unintended latches.

**Dynamic Circuit Behavior**: Post-synthesis simulation can reveal dynamic circuit behaviors that static methods might miss, ensuring the design operates correctly under real-world conditions.

**Identifying Issues**: It helps in identifying issues that may not be apparent in pre-synthesis simulations, such as glitches or race conditions due to the actual gate delays.

The first step in the design flow is to synthesize the generated RTL code, followed by simulating the result. This process helps uncover more about the code and its potential bugs. In this section, we will synthesize our code and then perform a post-synthesis simulation to look for any issues. Ideally, the post-synthesis and pre-synthesis (modeling section) results should be identical, confirming that the synthesis process has not altered the original design behavior.

#### Why do pre-synthesis simulation? Why not just do post-synthesis simulation?
Pre-synthesis simulation is crucial for verifying the logical functionality of a digital design before it undergoes synthesis. It allows designers to detect and correct logical errors, such as incorrect operator usage or unintended latch inference, early in the development process. This type of simulation focuses solely on the high-level behavior of the design, enabling faster iterations and design exploration without the constraints of gate-level details. On the other hand, post-synthesis simulation, or gate-level simulation, is essential for timing verification and ensuring that the synthesized design meets real-world performance requirements. It accounts for gate delays and helps identify any synthesis-induced issues, providing a final validation of both functionality and timing before the design is implemented in hardware. Together, these simulations ensure a robust and reliable digital design.

Here is the step-by-step execution plan for running the  commands manually:
---
### **Step 1: Load the Top-Level Design and Supporting Modules**
- Launch the yosys synthesis tool from your working directory.
```bash
yosys
```
<img width="747" height="476" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a997b5e7-dba1-485f-a987-bcf63055fdc2" />
 
- Read the main vsdbabysoc.v RTL file into the yosys environment.
```bash
yosys> read_verilog src/module/vsdbabysoc.v 
```
<img width="694" height="103" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b58c73d-f7a7-4de6-8746-2adec49e199c" />

- The following cp commands copy essential header files from the src/include directory into the working directory. These include:

  **sp_verilog.vh** – contains Verilog definitions and macros

  **sandpiper.vh** – holds integration-related definitions for SandPiper

  **sandpiper_gen.vh** – may include auto-generated or tool-generated parameters

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC
cp -r src/include/sp_verilog.vh .
cp -r src/include/sandpiper.vh .
cp -r src/include/sandpiper_gen.vh .
ls
```

<img width="983" height="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7951f285-e36b-4fb0-9b12-2f354fb9e9b3" />

- Read the rvmyth.v file with the include path using -I option.
```bash
yosys> read_verilog -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include/ ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/rvmyth.v
```
<img width="1214" height="170" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/348a7e42-9653-47f0-a3e5-d13e00b62ded" />

#### ❗Note:

_If you try to read the rvmyth.v file using yosys without copying the necessary header files first, you may encounter errors.

_To avoid these errors, make sure to copy the required include files into your working directory! This ensures Yosys can resolve them correctly during parsing, even if the -I option is used._

- Read the clk_gate.v file with the include path using -I option.

```bash
yosys> read_verilog -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include/ ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/clk_gate.v
```

### **Step 2: Load the Liberty Files for Synthesis**
Inside the same yosys shell, run:
```bash
read_liberty -lib ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsdpll.lib 
read_liberty -lib ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsddac.lib 
read_liberty -lib ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
