# Week 7 Task – BabySoC Physical Design & Post-Route SPEF Generation

This document presents the complete physical design implementation of the BabySoC using OpenROAD, covering all stages from floorplanning to post-route parasitic extraction (SPEF generation). The objective of this task is to integrate the theoretical and practical aspects of digital design by executing a full RTL-to-GDSII flow on a real System-on-Chip (SoC).

Through this exercise, the BabySoC design undergoes floorplan definition, standard cell placement, routing, and parasitic extraction to reflect a realistic ASIC design process. Each stage is explored to understand how physical parameters—such as floorplan constraints, placement density, and routing topology—affect timing performance and design closure.

The outcome of this work is a fully placed and routed BabySoC layout, accompanied by a generated SPEF file that enables post-route Static Timing Analysis (STA). This provides insight into how parasitic effects influence signal delay and how accurate timing verification is performed in professional VLSI design environments.

Comprehensive screenshots, step-by-step procedures, and observations are documented to demonstrate the design flow, tools used, challenges encountered, and verification results.

### Simulation Steps

#### <ins>Pre-Synthesis Simulation</ins>

Run the following command to perform a pre-synthesis simulation:

```bash
cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
mkdir -p output/pre_synth_sim
iverilog -o ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/testbench.v
```
<img width="1213" height="83" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab5e9f18-0fb7-4df9-86ca-066c14474a9a" />

Then run:
```bash
cd output/pre_synth_sim
./pre_synth_sim.out
```
<img width="894" height="44" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/506fb2e0-ab37-474d-a88a-68a75d6c3952" />

Explanation:

- DPRE_SYNTH_SIM: Defines the PRE_SYNTH_SIM macro for conditional compilation in the testbench.
- The resulting pre_synth_sim.vcd file can be viewed in GTKWave.

#### Viewing Waveform in GTKWave

After running the simulation, open the VCD file in GTKWave: 

```bash

cd ~/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/
gtkwave output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.vcd

```
Drag and drop the CLK, reset, OUT (DAC), and RV TO DAC [9:0] signals to their respective locations in the simulation tool

<img width="1212" height="766" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c35f8dc-449a-417e-ad87-fba903b1f253" />

In this picture we can see the following signals:

**CLK**: This is the input CLK signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from the PLL, originally.

**reset**: This is the input reset signal of the RVMYTH core. This signal comes from an external source, originally.

**OUT**: This is the output OUT signal of the VSDBabySoC module. This signal comes from the DAC (due to simulation restrictions it behaves like a digital signal which is incorrect), originally.

**RV_TO_DAC[9:0]**: This is the 10-bit output [9:0] OUT port of the RVMYTH core. This port comes from the RVMYTH register #17, originally.

**OUT**: This is a real datatype wire which can simulate analog values. It is the output wire real OUT signal of the DAC module. This signal comes from the DAC, originally. 

This can be viewed by changing the Data Format of the signal to Analog → Step

#### Viewing DAC output in analog mode

Drag and drop the CLK, reset, OUT (DAC) (as analog step), and RV TO DAC [9:0] signals to their respective locations in the simulation tool

### Trouble shooting tips

   - Module Redefinition: If you encounter redefinition errors, ensure modules are included only once, either in the testbench or in the command line.
   - Path Issues: Verify paths specified with -I are correct. Use full paths if relative paths cause errors.

## Why Pre-Synthesis and Post-Synthesis?

1. **Pre-Synthesis Simulation**: 
   - Focuses only on verifying functionality based on the RTL code.
   - Zero-delay environment, with events occurring on the active clock edge.

2. **Post-Synthesis Simulation (GLS)**:
   - Uses the synthesized netlist (gate-level) to simulate both functionality and timing.
   - Identifies timing violations and potential mismatches (e.g., unintended latches).
   - Helps verify dynamic circuit behavior that static methods may miss.

## VSDBabySoC Post-Synthesis Simulation

Post-synthesis simulation is a critical step in the digital design flow, providing insights into both the functionality and timing of the synthesized design. 

Unlike pre-synthesis simulation, which focuses solely on verifying the functionality based on the RTL code, post-synthesis simulation uses the synthesized netlist to ensure that the design behaves correctly in terms of both logic and timing.

Key aspects of post-synthesis simulation include:

**Functionality and Timing Verification**: It checks the design's functionality and timing using the gate-level netlist, helping identify timing violations and potential mismatches such as unintended latches.

**Dynamic Circuit Behavior**: Post-synthesis simulation can reveal dynamic circuit behaviors that static methods might miss, ensuring the design operates correctly under real-world conditions.

**Identifying Issues**: It helps in identifying issues that may not be apparent in pre-synthesis simulations, such as glitches or race conditions due to the actual gate delays.

The first step in the design flow is to synthesize the generated RTL code, followed by simulating the result. This process helps uncover more about the code and its potential bugs. In this section, we will synthesize our code and then perform a post-synthesis simulation to look for any issues. Ideally, the post-synthesis and pre-synthesis (modeling section) results should be identical, confirming that the synthesis process has not altered the original design behavior.

#### Why do pre-synthesis simulation? Why not just do post-synthesis simulation?
Pre-synthesis simulation is crucial for verifying the logical functionality of a digital design before it undergoes synthesis. It allows designers to detect and correct logical errors, such as incorrect operator usage or unintended latch inference, early in the development process. This type of simulation focuses solely on the high-level behavior of the design, enabling faster iterations and design exploration without the constraints of gate-level details. On the other hand, post-synthesis simulation, or gate-level simulation, is essential for timing verification and ensuring that the synthesized design meets real-world performance requirements. It accounts for gate delays and helps identify any synthesis-induced issues, providing a final validation of both functionality and timing before the design is implemented in hardware. Together, these simulations ensure a robust and reliable digital design.

Here is the step-by-step execution plan for running the  commands manually:
---
### **Step 1: Load the Top-Level Design and Supporting Modules**
- Launch the yosys synthesis tool from your working directory.
```bash
yosys
```
<img width="747" height="476" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a997b5e7-dba1-485f-a987-bcf63055fdc2" />
 
- Read the main vsdbabysoc.v RTL file into the yosys environment.
```bash
yosys> read_verilog src/module/vsdbabysoc.v 
```
<img width="694" height="103" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b58c73d-f7a7-4de6-8746-2adec49e199c" />

- The following cp commands copy essential header files from the src/include directory into the working directory. These include:

  **sp_verilog.vh** – contains Verilog definitions and macros

  **sandpiper.vh** – holds integration-related definitions for SandPiper

  **sandpiper_gen.vh** – may include auto-generated or tool-generated parameters

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC
cp -r src/include/sp_verilog.vh .
cp -r src/include/sandpiper.vh .
cp -r src/include/sandpiper_gen.vh .
ls
```

<img width="983" height="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7951f285-e36b-4fb0-9b12-2f354fb9e9b3" />

- Read the rvmyth.v file with the include path using -I option.
```bash
yosys> read_verilog -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include/ ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/rvmyth.v
```
<img width="1214" height="170" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/348a7e42-9653-47f0-a3e5-d13e00b62ded" />

#### ❗Note:

_If you try to read the rvmyth.v file using yosys without copying the necessary header files first, you may encounter errors.

_To avoid these errors, make sure to copy the required include files into your working directory! This ensures Yosys can resolve them correctly during parsing, even if the -I option is used._

- Read the clk_gate.v file with the include path using -I option.

```bash
yosys> read_verilog -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include/ ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/clk_gate.v
```

<img width="1046" height="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c010441f-6522-4346-9f01-02fae41767e5" />

### **Step 2: Load the Liberty Files for Synthesis**
Inside the same yosys shell, run:
```bash
read_liberty -lib ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsdpll.lib 
read_liberty -lib ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/avsddac.lib 
read_liberty -lib ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
<img width="1008" height="262" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d45b841-4db1-46d2-b4e3-da40f12a5bc0" />

### **Step 3: Run Synthesis Targeting `vsdbabysoc`**
```bash
yosys> synth -top vsdbabysoc
```
<img width="1219" height="771" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40ecdda6-f1e5-4928-b605-5bbba998d612" />

### **Step 4: Map D Flip-Flops to Standard Cells**

```bash
yosys> dfflibmap -liberty ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
<img width="1216" height="743" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18018ff1-e16f-46e8-8aed-cb89db2ddeb5" />

### **Step 5: Perform Optimization and Technology Mapping**
```bash
yosys> opt
yosys> abc -liberty ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib -script +strash;scorr;ifraig;retime;{D};strash;dch,-f;map,-M,1,{D}
```

| Step           | Purpose                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `strash`       | Structural hashing (reduces logic redundancy)                        |
| `scorr`        | Sequential sweeping for redundancy removal                           |
| `ifraig`       | Incremental FRAIGing (logic equivalence checking and optimization)   |
| `retime;{D}`   | Move registers across combinational logic to optimize timing         |
| `strash`       | Re-run structural hashing after retiming                             |
| `dch,-f`       | Delay-aware combinational optimization with fast mode                |
| `map,-M,1,{D}` | Map logic to gates minimizing area (`-M,1`) and retime-aware (`{D}`) |

### **Step 6: Perform Final Clean-Up and Renaming**

```bash
yosys> flatten
yosys> setundef -zero
yosys> clean -purge
yosys> rename -enumerate
```
| **Command**         | **Purpose / Usage**                                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flatten`           | Flattens the entire design hierarchy into a single-level netlist.                      |
| `setundef -zero`    | Replaces all undefined (`x`) logic values with logical `0` to avoid simulation issues. |
| `clean -purge`      | Removes all unused wires, cells, and modules; `-purge` makes it more aggressive.       |
| `rename -enumerate` | Renames internal wires and cells to unique, numbered names for consistency.            |

### **Step 8: Write the Synthesized Netlist**
```bash

yosys> write_verilog -noattr ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/post_synth_sim/vsdbabysoc.synth.v
```
<img width="929" height="196" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29f71fa3-ea09-49c6-bef4-1369223b37b2" />

## POST_SYNTHESIS SIMULATION AND WAVEFORMS
---

### **Step 1: Compile the Testbench**

Before running the iverilog command, copy the necessary standard cell and primitive models:
These files must be present in the same directory as the testbench (src/module) to resolve all module references during compilation.

You need to have sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop directory you can clone it from this [link](https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop)

```bash
~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module$ cp -r ~/Desktop/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v .
~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module$ cp -r ~/Desktop/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/my_lib/verilog_model/primitives.v .
```

To ensure that the synthesized Verilog file _(vsdbabysoc.synth.v)_ is available in the src/module directory for further processing or simulation, you can copy it from the output directory to the src/module directory. Here is the step to do that:
```bash
~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC$ cp -r ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/post_synth_sim/vsdbabysoc.synth.v ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/
```

Run the following `iverilog` command to compile the testbench:
```bash
iverilog -o ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/output/post_synth_sim/post_synth_sim.out -DPOST_SYNTH_SIM -DFUNCTIONAL -DUNIT_DELAY=#1 -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/include -I ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module ~/Desktop/VLSI/VSDBabySoC/src/module/testbench.v
```

## Comparing Pre-Synthesis and Post-Synthesis Output

To ensure that the synthesis process did not alter the original design behavior, the output from the pre-synthesis simulation was compared with the post-synthesis simulation.

Both simulations were run using GTKWave, and the resulting waveforms were observed.

✅ _The outputs match exactly, confirming that the functionality is preserved across the synthesis flow._

_This validates that the synthesized netlist is functionally equivalent to the RTL design._

#### Timing Analysis and Reporting

OpenSTA provides a rich set of commands for analyzing timing paths, delays, and setup/hold checks:

- `report_checks`  
  Reports timing violations across specified paths using options like `-from`, `-through`, and `-to`. Supports multi-path analysis to any endpoint.

  ```tcl
  report_checks -from [get_pins U1/Q] -to [get_pins U2/D]
  ```
#### Timing Paths 

`What do you mean by Timing Paths?`
* It Refer to the logical paths a signal takes through a digital circuit from its source to its destination, including sequential and combinational elements. STA analyzes timing paths to determine their delay, setup and hold times, and other timing parameters specified in the constraints. Timing paths are categorized into combinatorial and sequential, and the critical path is the longest path in the design with the maximum operating frequency.

#### Timing Path Elements
   
Timing path elements in STA are the start point, where a signal originates, the end point, where it terminates, and the combinational logic elements, such as gates, that the signal passes through. Timing paths are traced to determine the overall delay and timing performance of the digital circuit.

**Start Point**: Is the point where the signal originates or enters the digital circuit. This point is typically an input port of the design, where the signal is first introduced to the circuit.

The start point of a timing path can be either:

- An input port, where data enters the design, or

- The clock pin of a register, where data is launched on a clock edge.

**End Point:** Is the point where the signal terminates or leaves the digital circuit. This point is typically an output port of the design, where the signal is outputted from the circuit.

The end point of a timing path can be either:

- A register's data input pin (D pin), where data is captured by the clock edge, or

- An output port, where data must be available at a specific time.

**Combinational Logic:** Combinational logic elements are the building blocks of a digital circuit and are used to perform logic operations on the signals passing through the circuit. These elements do not store any information, and the output of a combinational logic element is solely determined by the input values at that moment.

The diagram illustrates four distinct timing paths:

Path 1: Input to Register (in2reg)

Path 2: Register to Register (reg2reg)

Path 3: Register to Output (reg2out)

Path 4: Input to Output (in2out)

#### Setup and Hold Checks

-> **What is Setup Check?**
* Is the minimum time that the data must be stable before the clock edge, and if this time is not met, it can lead to setup violations, resulting in incorrect data being stored in the sequential element. The setup check is essential to ensure correct timing behavior of a digital circuit and prevent data loss or other timing-related issues.
* The setup time of a flip-flop depends on the technology node, operating conditions, and other factors. The value of the setup time is usually provided in the logic libraries.

-> **What is Hold Check?**
* Is the minimum amount of time that the data must remain stable after the clock edge, and if this time is not met, it can lead to hold violations, resulting in incorrect data being stored in the sequential element. The hold check is necessary to prevent issues such as data corruption, metastability, and other timing-related problems in digital circuits.

#### Slack Calculation 

Setup and hold slack is defined as the difference between data required time and data arrivals time. 

>Setup slack = Data required time - Data arrival time

>Hold slack = Data arrival time - Data required time

-> **What is Data Arrival Time?**
* The time taken by the signal to travel from the start point to the end point of the digital circuit. 

-> **What is Data Required Time?** 
* The time for the clock to traverse through the clock path of the digital circuit. 

-> **What is Slack?** 
* It is difference between the desired arrival times and the actual arrival time for a signal. 
* Positive Slack indicates that the design is meeting the timing and still it can be improved. 
* Zero slack means that the design is critically working at the desired frequency. 
* Negative slack means, design has not achieved the specified timings at the specified frequency.
* Slack has to be positive always and negative slack indicates a violation in timing.

#### Common SDC Constraints

In Static Timing Analysis (STA), **Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC)** are used to define the behavior, environment, and timing requirements of a digital design. These constraints are categorized based on their function and purpose.

**Operating Conditions** are set using the `set_operating_conditions` command, which defines the process-voltage-temperature (PVT) corner used during analysis.

**Wire-Load Models** such as `set_wire_load_mode`, `set_wire_load_model`, and `set_wire_load_selection_group` are used to estimate interconnect capacitance and resistance based on fanout and hierarchy when post-layout parasitics are unavailable.

**Environmental Constraints** define the electrical behavior of I/Os. The `set_drive` and `set_driving_cell` commands model input driving strength or source cell characteristics. Output loads are described using `set_load` or `set_fanout_load`. Additional attributes like `set_input_transition` (input slew) and `set_port_fanout_number` (expected output fanout) further refine environment models.

**Design Rule Constraints** ensure physical design adherence. These include `set_max_capacitance` to limit load, `set_max_fanout` to cap number of loads, and `set_max_transition` to restrict slew for signal integrity and EM/IR compliance.

**Timing Constraints** are the core of STA. `create_clock` defines primary clocks, while `create_generated_clock` handles derived clocks. Clock behavior is further detailed using `set_clock_latency`, `set_clock_transition`, and `set_clock_uncertainty`. Timing analysis can be guided with `set_propagated_clock` to consider actual delays, or `set_disable_timing` to ignore specific paths.

Signal timing is modeled using `set_input_delay` and `set_output_delay`. The `set_input_delay` command specifies when input data arrives relative to the clock edge, crucial for setup/hold timing analysis. The `set_output_delay` command defines the required time by which output signals must be valid, helping STA tools verify that data is launched and captured within acceptable timing windows.

**Timing Exceptions** allow control over non-functional or multi-cycle paths. `set_false_path` removes paths from analysis, `set_max_delay` restricts path delay, and `set_multicycle_path` increases the allowed number of clock cycles for timing paths that do not need single-cycle timing closure.

Lastly, **Power Constraints** help manage dynamic and leakage power budgets using `set_max_dynamic_power` and `set_max_leakage_power`. These are especially useful in power-aware synthesis and verification flows.
